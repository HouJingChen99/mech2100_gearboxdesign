# mech2100_gearboxdesign
python script for the gearbox design assignment

gears: for the required input and output speeds and sdistance between the intermediate and output shaft, produce a txt file with the possible gear combinations that satisfy the requirements

gear forces: calculates teh bending and contant stresses acting on each gear 

distance plot: plots gears 3, 4 and the idler in the configuration that satisfies the sdistance

shaft forces: calculates the gear forces acting on each shaft and the reaction forces from the bearings. Also calculates the shear and bending foraces at the critical points and plots the bending moment diagrams 

bearings: computes the required dynamic loading for the bearings on each shaft support

shaft stresses: calculates the bending stresses and torsional stresses acting on the shaft, and finds the factor of safety considering the stress concentration factors
